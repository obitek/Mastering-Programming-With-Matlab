function ok = palindrome(txt)

    ok = true;                      % it is a palindrome. Base case.
  else                              %    else
    ok = (txt(1) == txt(end) && ... % the first and last digits must be the same, and
        palindrome(txt(2:end-1)));  % what's in the middle must be a palindrome too
